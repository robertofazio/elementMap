elementMap alpha 0.3.0 28/11/2012

OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE FOR 3D STEREOSCOPIC PROJECTION MAPPING 

Element.Map is an open source project that enhances the use of stereoscopic contents for 3d projection mapping. It is developed entirely in openFrameworks,  an open source C++ toolkit for creative coding.  Element.Map allows you to manage 3d stereoscopic video contents to project them onto architectural structures and volumes.



Basically it is a simple stereoscopic video player with some useful functions for  projection mapping projects such as Quad warping and Fine Warping. It works in side by side L/R and T/B active, Anagliph, and OpenGL modes. It is based on the stereo active mode and requires an OpenGL quad buffer hardware capability [ here ].

One of its main feature is the ability to broadcast Full HD 1920 x 1080 contents in photojpeg codec  up to 10 GB end even more.
